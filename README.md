# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we will use to store our data and pgAdmin will be used as an interface to query the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the machine library we'll be using to create a classifier. We plan on using a linear regression model and either ridge regression or lasso regression.

## Dashboard
Tableau will be used to create a dashboard to display the results of our analysis.
