## Dashboard

We will be using Tableau to create a storyboard of a dashboard to display data findings. For our analysis we are currently working with 3 different datasets from 2015 and 2016: World Happiness Report, Human Freedom Index, and Life expectancy Report. We've already merged the dataset into a dataframe in Pandas. The Dataframe was exported as a CSV file then loaded to Tableau Public. 

## Storyboard

Our merged dataset includes 116 countries from 2015 and 116 countries from 2016. In addition, the countries are classified into regions. For our storyboard, we've already created an interactive world map that can be filtered on the country name, year, region, and happiness score.
