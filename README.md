# Final-Group-Project
Shared repository for final group project

## Presentation

## Communication Plan

The communication plan will be a guiding document outlining our means of communication, and our risk and issues management. It also outlines the team structure, the roles and responsibilities of each team member per segment, and our approval process for our work.

### Communications Tools for "The Ladies" a.k.a Group 2 project team

#### Team Structure

The team structure is modeled around **four (4) roles**. The roles will be rotated troughout the lenght of the project amongst the four (4) students composing the team. The roles are structured as explained below:
- **Square**: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository.
- **Triangle**: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.
- **Circle**: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.
- **X**: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project

The members composing this team are:
- Assitan Ciss√©
- Dian Borkar
- Merelynn (Lynn) Okang
- Gloria Yahouedeou

#### Meeting Plan

In addition to actively using the designated Slack channel created for Group 2 for chats and questions, the team has agreed to three weekly timeslots to collaborate on the project:
- Mondays from 6-8 pm EST.
- Fridays from 6-8 pm EST. (During Office Hours)
- Sundays from 7-11 pm EST. (Work submission review)

Team members unable to attend these group work opportunities use the Slack channel to notify other members of progress, issues, or availability.

#### Risk and Issue Management

This team recognize that risk and issue may arise trough the course of our collaboration. The team has listed below potential problems that might arise during the project, their causes, symptoms, consequences, and possible solutions.

| Date Recorded | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 04-22-2021  | Choosing a database that provides a poor machine learning output  | Medium | High  | Consulting TAs to guide us at each step of the process |
| 04-22-2021  | A team member feeling overworked or underworked  | Medium  | Medium  | For each segment, the team agrees to a breakdown of the deliverables and offer/receives support where needed   |


The risk register above will be periodically updated to list any issue that may have come up. For high propability and high impact issue that have no mitigation in place, the team will:
